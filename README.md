# Black Ops 4 Class Generator

## Story
I needed a project to build for practice as I learned to code. I found it hard to think of an idea for some reason, so I decided that it would be great to combine my hobbies and programming. Six months after Black Ops 4, I got bored and decided to make this generator. I want to develop a website version of the project in the future.
## What It Does
This project builds a random class for Call of Duty Black Ops 4 and gives users weapons, perks, equipment, gear, and scorestreaks. Black ops four multiplayer class setups work on a 10 point system. Meaning the class can only have ten items maximum.
This generator would be helpful when you are tired of using the same class setup. With this, you can switch your class setup and add more fun to Call of Duty.
