# Black Ops 4 ClassGenerator

## Story
As I learned to code, I needed a project to build for practice. For some reason, I found it hard to think of an idea, so I decided that it would be great to combine my hobbies and programming. Six months after Black Ops 4, I got bored and decided to make this generator. In the future, I would like to develop a website version of the project.
## What It Does
This project creates a random class for Call of Duty Black Ops 4. Gives user weapons, perks, equipment, gear, and also scorestreaks. Lack ops 4 multiplayer class setups work on a 10 point system. Meaning the class can only have 10 items maximum.
This generator would be helpful when you are tired of using the same class setup. With this, you can switch your class setup and add some more fun to Call of Duty.
